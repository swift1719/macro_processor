# Macro-processor

> A macro processor is a system software. Macro is that the Section of code that the programmer writes (defines) once, and then can use or invokes many times.It is a program that copies a stream of text from one place to another, making a systematic set of replacements as it does so. Macro processors are often embedded in other programs, such as assemblers and compilers. Sometimes they are standalone programs that can be used to process any kind of text.
